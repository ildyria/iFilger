iFilger is a very minimal buff/debuff tracking addon that will allow you to track buffs/debuffs on yourself, target, pets, focus, etc, and also can be used to track cooldowns.

Buffs/debuffs/cooldowns can be displayed as both bars and icons, and stack sizes and durations will be shown.

Only the buffs/debuffs/cooldowns you want will be displayed, the addon uses a whitelist system and you have to tell it exactly what you want it to show. 

The default config is VERY bar/icon spammy, you'll probably want to go through and comment out a bunch of stuff for a usable setup.

Basic use
All configuration must be done by directly editing config/iFilger.lua, there are no config screens or slash commands.

Moving the bars

iFilger is a modified version of Filger with the core of ElvUI, all credit goes their authors!
