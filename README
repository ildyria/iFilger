iFilger is a very minimal buff/debuff tracking addon that will allow you to track buffs/debuffs on yourself, target, pets, focus, etc, and also can be used to track cooldowns.

Buffs/debuffs/cooldowns can be displayed as both bars and icons, and stack sizes and durations will be shown.

Only the buffs/debuffs/cooldowns you want will be displayed, the addon uses a whitelist system and you have to tell it exactly what you want it to show. 

The default config is VERY bar/icon spammy, you'll probably want to go through and comment out a bunch of stuff for a usable setup.

Basic use
All configuration must be done by directly editing iFilger.lua, there are no config screens or slash commands.

Moving the bars
Open sFilger.lua with a text editor and change local configmode = false; to local configmode = true; and reload your UI (/console reloadui). You can then hold down shift + alt, and drag the individual anchors. After positioning, you can reset configmode to false and reload your UI again.

Understanding the spell list
Taking Divine Plea as an example.

{ spellName = "Divine Plea", size = 13, scale = 1, unitId = "player", caster = "player", filter = "BUFF", barWidth = 104 },

spellName = The name of the spell you want to display, duh!
size = The size of the icon/height of the bar.
scale = Overall size of the icon/bar.
unitId = Which unit you want to display this bar for. Can be a number of units, player/target/pet/focus etc, take a look at the included entry for Earth Shield to see how you can display a bar for specific units only.
caster = Who cast the spell. You can limit the icon/bar display to spells cast only by a specific unit, or display no matter who cast it. Handy for displaying only your own sacred shield for example.
filter = BUFF, DEBUFF, or CD. Fairly self explanatory.
barWidth = The width of the bar.

Copying/modifying existing entries is the easiest way to get started.
